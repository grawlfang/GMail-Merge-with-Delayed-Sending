# GMail-Merge-with-Delayed-Sending
Adaptation of the GMail/Sheets Mail Merge App Script

Taken from https://developers.google.com/workspace/solutions/mail-merge
and mixed with answers from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32697653/how-can-i-pass-a-parameter-to-a-time-based-google-app-script-trigger

This version allows the user to specify a number of minutes to delay sending the emails (scheduled send)
It also allows the "Recipient" field to contain multiple email addresses separated by semi-colons.
